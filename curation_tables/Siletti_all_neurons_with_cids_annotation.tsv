CS202210140_4	Mono_3		CS202210140_463	Miscellaneous	Cluster	CL:0000576	monocyte	We then analyzed differentially expressed genes between clusters (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Cluster 1 displayed high expression of monocyte genes such as CTSS, FCN1, S100A9, LYZ, VCAN. Clusters 2 and 3 shared high expression of macrophage genes such as LGMN, CTSB, CD14, APOE, C1QB, MARCO, CD163, FCGR3A. Cluster 4 expressed high levels of monocyte and macrophage-related genes such as FCN1, S100A9, VCAN, S100A8, MAFB. Clusters 5 and 6 expressed monocyte-related genes such as FCN1, S100A9, VCAN, FCGR1A, FCGR1B, as well as DC genes including CD1C, FCER1A, IFITM2, CLEC10A, FCGR2B. (Tang-Huau et al., 2018).  From  https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP424/single-cell-comparison-pbmc-data#study-visualize : VCAN is not expressed much in CD16+ monocytes; TYROBP from the 10X single-cell PBMC data; FCN1 may also mark dendritic cells; CD14 expression seems too low to use as a marker.
